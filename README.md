# [Data Science Portfolio](https://www.datascienceportfol.io/Q15analytics)

Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Allow me to reintroduce myself my name is Sam

I'm a freelance data professional and continuous learner of all things data science and personal development.

ðŸ”­ I focus on business intelligence projects for SME consumer businesses that specialise in sports, health and fitness.

I empower them to use data to make better and more profitable decisions.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people with good energy on interesting and impactful projects. If you run or represent a business that fits the above description and are looking for ways to optimise what you do then I'd be open to having a conversation about how we can collaborate.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a massive sports fan so I also do sports analytics as a passion project. If you love football (not NFL), basketball or combat sports and want to talk xG, VORP and RPM then hit me up!
